# Addons-Handler
A Unity EditorWindow to handle VRCSDK 3.0 (Avatar and World) addons, tools and scripts.

## How to
It is very easy to use.

Download the latest version in releases.

Import it into your project.

At the top, in the MenuItems, go to VRChat SDK then SDK Addons.

A window should open.

There you can see the project and editor info or change the editor mode to Easy or Advanced, which without sdk either says "There is no SDK Loaded! Please change the editor mode to 'Advanced' to continue!" or it shows buttons which have the names of tools/scripts which when clicked will download and import the tool/script.
